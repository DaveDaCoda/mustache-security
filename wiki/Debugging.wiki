== Overwrite, break, call stack ===

{{{
 #1window.alert = function(a){
 #2
B#3 return confirm(a)
 #4}
}}}

== Load JavaScript from raw.github.com ==

     
Won't work - annoying:

{{{
<script onerror="alert('Nay, won\'t load')" src="https://raw.github.com/creationix/haml-js/master/lib/haml.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
}}}
  
Using view-source. Works perfectly fine:

{{{
<script onload="alert('Yay - here we are!')" src="view-source:https://raw.github.com/creationix/haml-js/master/lib/haml.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
}}}

== Where is my Code? ==
