#summary Some small tricks and howtos around JSMVC

= Introduction =

It's not always easy to debug a website using JavaScript MVC and client side templating engines. Especially when you don't have access to the uncompressed and editable sources. And, what a coincidence, that usually tends to happen during black-box penetration tests. 

The following paragraphs will describe a bunch of small and trivial yet maybe helpful tricks to make pentesting and "remote debugging" JS MVC apps a bit easier - and maybe help spotting the one of the other XSS bug, that would otherwise have left unseen.

== Overwrite, break, call stack ===

{{{
 #1window.alert = function(a){
 #2
B#3 return confirm(a)
 #4}
}}}

== Load JavaScript from raw.github.com ==

     
Won't work - annoying:

{{{
<script onerror="alert('Nay, won\'t load')" src="https://raw.github.com/creationix/haml-js/master/lib/haml.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
}}}
  
Using view-source. Works perfectly fine:

{{{
<script onload="alert('Yay - here we are!')" src="view-source:https://raw.github.com/creationix/haml-js/master/lib/haml.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
}}}

And also this works - thanks @mathias (be aware that this domain is maintained by some dude out there and might or might not work as you hope):

{{{
<script onload="alert('Yay - here we are!')" src="https://rawgithub.com/creationix/haml-js/master/lib/haml.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
}}}
