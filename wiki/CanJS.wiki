= Introduction =

"Want to share code between a Zepto mobile app and a jQuery desktop app? No problem. CanJS code (especially models) can be shared across libraries, and so can skill sets! Working on a Dojo project today and a YUI one tomorrow? Donâ€™t throw away all of your skills."

= Injection Attacks =

CanJS uses ERB-style templates by default. Everything that is placed in-between the `<%` and `%>` or its siblings is being treated as raw JavaScript. CanJS throws the content of the ERB-style templates into an actual `eval` method - that is called `myEval` but doesn't do anything but wrapping the real `eval`.

In other words: whenever the user has control over content of the ERB-style template blocks, script injections and XSS are very much likely. The "paste-and-go" code example below shows several cases an attacker can use to bypass server- and browser side XSS filters in case the attacked CanJS application allows injections.

== Eval via myEval ==

CanJS takes it easy and simply throws the extracted template data into a string, wrapped by a bunch of `with()` blocks and afterwards sends it to an `eval`. That's all.

{{{
myEval = function(script) {
    eval(script);
}, 

[...]

var template = buff.join(''), 
out = {
    out: 'with(_VIEW) { with (_CONTEXT) {' + template + " " + finishTxt + "}}"
};
// Use `eval` instead of creating a function, because it is easier to debug.
myEval.call(out, 'this.fn = (function(_CONTEXT,_VIEW){' + out.out + '});\r\n//@ sourceURL=' + name + ".js");
                
return out;
}}}
